# TODO

- Select excercise Tier/Week/Day through radio buttons.
- Listen to keyboard keys. `spacebar`/`enter` should trigger the `Go` button. `up`/`down` arrows should select the type of exercise, while `left`/`right` cycle through programs (day/week/etc).
- Design the exercise database and populate it with at least four different exercise types.
- Increment the excercise program list with information about exercises.
- Implement full functionality and visuals for the exercise program list.
